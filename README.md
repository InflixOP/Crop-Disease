# Crop-Diease-Detection
## A Deep Learniing Project 

## Introduction
- Agricultural production rate plays a vital role in the economic
development of a country.
● The identification of plant diseases at an early stage is crucial for global health and wellbeing. So, controlling on the diseased leaves
during the growing stages of crops is a crucial step.
● Moreover, increasing crop production is essential to areas where food is scarce.
Loss of crops from plant diseases would result in
reduction of income for crop producers, higher
prices for consumers and significant economic
impact.
● The access to disease-control methods is limited
which results in annual losses of 30 to 50
percent for major crops in various countries. 
● Hence, detection of crop diseases is very crucial
for economic development.

## Problem Motivation
- In these present situations, it is difficult for farmers to sell their products at a fair price in markets. Customers are buying hybrid fruits and vegetables which are not good for health which contain harmful substances.
- Customers are buying products at a higher price than the market price.

## Problem Statement
Detect the crop diseases and differentiate between various crop diseases for a particular plant 

Worked with appropriate neural network image classification algorithms like CNN, Inception-V3 and VGG-16. 
● Choosing 
Farmers can sell fruits, vegetables, and dairy products at fair market prices on our website and customers can buy directly organic products from farmers through the website which are fresh and healthy for the body.
 
## Problem Solution
